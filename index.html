          I know Valentine's Day has come and gone, but I suppose some things don't
          need a date on the calendar to be said. And honestly, I don’t mind
          that… because loving you has never been about one day or grand
          gestures. It's been about every single day I get to call you mine.<br /><br />

          Babe, the truth is, my favorite parts of our relationship don't look
          like scenes from a romantic comedy. <br /><br />

          They’re the late-night calls that stretch into early morning (when
          neither of us sleeps off 🌚), voice notes that I replay just to hear
          your voice again, the Sundays you grace my eyes with pictures of you,
          our random and very rare video calls 😂, the unplanned yet anticipated
          travels just to see one another, and the way you somehow make the most
          ordinary moments feel special.
        </p>

          I love the way your presence lingers long after we part, how your
          laughter echoes in my thoughts (I mean, when you laugh genuinely 🌚),
          and I love how the thought of you brings me peace.<br /><br />
          I catch myself smiling at the memory of your little quirks, the ones
          that only I know and cherish, and I realize that love, for me, has
          always been these moments with you.<br /><br />
          Loving you has always been about the seemingly small things. The
          details I notice. The smile I carry with me whenever I think about
          you. The future I catch myself imagining, even in the brief pauses of
          my day.

          And when you call me “baby”—God, I don't know how you make a single
          word feel like everything I need to hear. But you do 😂❤️. I guess
          that’s why I chose this song playing in the background (*proceeds to
          sing 🎵”and when you call me ‘baby’ you know that it makes me loooose
          control”🎵)<br /><br />
          Over time, I’ve called you quite a number of pet names and some rather
          funny nicknames I must admit (Baby Mercy, Telepizu, Leader of
          Tomorrow… just to mention a few 😂)—I keep searching for the right
          words, because somehow one is never enough to capture everything you
          are to me. But baby girl, the truth is simpler than any nickname…
          you're my person. <br /><br />
          You're the one I reach for when the world feels too heavy, and the
          first person I want to run to when something good happens… because it
          doesn't even feel “real” until I've shared it with you.

          I spend a lot of time thinking about how lucky I am to have found a
          partner who is so deeply genuine. I love the way your mind works, the
          way you navigate challenges, the grace you show to the people around
          you, the way you are assertive (often strikes a nerve, but I love it
          nonetheless 😂), and I love how your voice melts my heart.<br /><br />
          I love you, Hephzibah ❤️… not just in the “Valentine's card” kind of
          way, but in a way that has changed how I see life. In a “I didn't know
          I was looking for you until I found you” kind of way.

          While the rest of the world may have packed up the “season of love”
          until next year, my appreciation for you won’t reset. Whether it is a
          late Thursday in February, your birthday in June, or some completely
          random Tuesday, you’re the person I want in my corner. You are my safe
          space, my heart in human form 🤭, my best friend, and I love you more
          than words could ever truly express.

          So here's to us, and to the love between us, not just on a day marked
          on the calendar per se, but every single day we get to share.<br /><br />
          Consider this a slightly delayed Valentine's gift, or perhaps just a
          love letter for no particular reason at all 🌚❤️. Thank you for
          choosing me, for loving me, and for letting me be the one who gets to
          hold your hand through it all. ❤️
