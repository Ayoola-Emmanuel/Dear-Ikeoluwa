          First off, I want you to bask in the knowledge that you are not just
          an absolute precious gift from God, you are a precious gift I intend
          to cherish for the rest of my life. Now that I've established that.
          It's Valentine's Day! And it's one of the many days that I get to
          specially make you smile.

          I love you. I love you first because your existence on this earth
          makes the world a much brighter place. Then I love you even more
          because of your kindness and thoughtfulness towards others around you.
          Indeed. you are God's proof of love to me.

          I've heard people say a few times that you can't truly know something
          until you experience it. I thought that was basic and understandable
          but that was until I met you. It was when I met you that I truly
          understood that all along, I actually thought I knew love but I
          didn't. It took you coming into my life for me to fully understand
          what love is.

          I now feel it, I now experience it, I now know it and to be honest,
          there's no better feeling. I'm overwhelmed with joy at the thought of
          you being my ride or ride (cos nobody's dying here 😅). <br />It's
          incredibly amazing that I get to be your boyfriend!

          I have come to realize that apart from Jesus, no one completes me more
          than you do. You are a piece that fits perfectly, right at the centre
          of my heart. It's so beautiful that I get to love you and be loved by
          you and I'm forever grateful for this bond that we share. Love is less
          of a headache and more of absolute bliss because it's you I'm doing it
          with.

          In the four months of doing this love thing with you, it’s not just
          the light in your eyes or your beautiful smile that fascinates me but
          your kindness and your beautiful heart. I'm totally enamoured by all
          that you embody and all that this bond with you portrays.

          I now see life in more beautiful colours, in more exciting forms and
          in more enjoyable bits because of the moments and memories with you. I
          have learnt strength, persistence and true love from the firm support
          your body, heart and soul give me.

          My heart leaps for joy knowing that it's safe in your company and my
          soul stays rest assured that you are always there (through the
          sunshine, the rain and the rainbow). How beautiful is it to have a
          companion to journey with through these seasons? I can answer that
          question; Very Beautiful!

          Thank you for making me better, for making life better and for pushing
          me to be the best version of myself and acing the things I never
          expected I would. Today and always, I want you to know that I'm not
          just in love with you. I cherish you and I appreciate you for all that
          you are and all that you do.

          Ikeoluwa, it's very beautiful to be with you, to be loved by you and
          to be in love with you. How did I get so lucky? Nobody else can make
          me feel the way you make me feel and it goes to show how special you
          are to me. You're my person, Ikeoluwa, there is really none other for
          me like you.

          My entire being is attracted to you and totally in love with you!
          Every inch of you is a work of art, and I’ll never stop being in awe
          of you. The scent of your hair, the way your skin feels under my
          fingertips—these little things stay in my mind like a song on repeat.
          To me, the warmth of your touch feels like home.

          I want you to know that I absolutely adore you and appreciate you. You
          have no idea! Thank you for being my person, through and through. For
          all the times that you’ve been an incredible support system (knowingly
          or unknowingly), the times that you have shown me unconditional love,
          and for doing everything possible to make sure this works.
